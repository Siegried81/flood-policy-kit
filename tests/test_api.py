"""Tests for the JSON API the React UI reads.

The failure modes pinned here are the ones where a wrong number still *looks*
like a number: a total summed over nested return periods, a ranking built on a
period nobody chose, a polygon reaching the prompt, and a provider's empty turn
arriving as a 500. Every one of them was reachable with no error anywhere.

No network: `rag.complete` and `rag.search` are monkeypatched in every test that
touches them, and `rag.load_index` is stubbed out of `/api/meta` so the suite
never reads the corpus off disk.
