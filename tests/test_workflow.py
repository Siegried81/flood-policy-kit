"""Tests for the workflow layer.

Two things are pinned here. The state reporting, because a responsible-AI
deliverable that silently recorded nothing is worse than one that admits it did
not. And the two branches that decide whether anything is written at all: the
refusal when retrieval is empty, and the human gate's three outcomes.

The graph runs for real - langgraph, a real checkpointer, real interrupts - with
the model replaced by a recorder. The assertion that matters most in here is a
call count of zero: "a refused question costs no LLM call" is only provable by
counting the calls.
