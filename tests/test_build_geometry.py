"""Tests for the choropleth's geometry file.

The map is the deliverable the jury looks at first, and it failed silently in
two ways that no exception reports: a file keyed on GISCO's own `NUTS_ID` joins
to nothing and draws 1,345 grey polygons, and a file left in EPSG:3035 is drawn
by `Choropleth.jsx` as metres-as-degrees, which puts Europe somewhere off the
coast of Antarctica at a scale of thousands. Both render "successfully". These
tests pin the two properties that make the file usable rather than merely valid.
