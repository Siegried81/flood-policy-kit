/**
 * What qualifies an exposure figure, without being one.
 *
 * Three layers from a second frozen table: how river discharge moves under a
 * future climate, how much built-up surface sits in the flood zone, and how far
 * a region's basin reaches across a national border. None of them is an exposure
 * count, and none of them is ever merged into the exposure rows - the
 * vulnerability index is a weighted mean over whatever numeric columns it is
 * offered, so a climate percentage carried on an exposure row would be one
 * selection away from making "this region's rivers rise faster" a term in a
 * vulnerability score.
 *
 * The component's real job is the climate caveat. The CDS archive holds two
 * hydrological model chains for 2011-2040 and 2041-2070 and only one for
 * 2071-2100, and a single chain cannot agree with itself: the server reports
 * zero regions agreeing on the sign for that period. That zero is
 * indistinguishable from "the chains point different ways" unless the page says
 * which, and those are different claims - one is "we do not know yet", the other
 * is "we looked and the models conflict". So a one-chain period renders its
 * reason instead of a ranking, and there is deliberately no way to read a
 * direction off it.
 *
 * The median still shows, because it is a real measurement. It is simply not a
 * projection.
