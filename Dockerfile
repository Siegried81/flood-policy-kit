# Container image for the flood policy kit (Streamlit map, JSON API, CLI, tests).
#
# This image is not a packaging nicety here, it is how the geospatial half of the
# kit runs at all. On the Windows host, `rasterio`, `pyogrio`, `rasterstats` and
# `tiktoken` all fail at import: an application-control policy blocks the native
# DLLs the wheels ship ("Une strategie de controle d'application a bloque ce
# fichier", and GDAL therefore never lands on PATH). Nothing in the Python layer
# can work around that, so every zonal statistic, every vector read and every
# token count has to happen inside Linux.
#
# **Why pip wheels and not a GDAL base image.** That blocked-DLL failure is a
# host policy, not a missing GDAL: `rasterio`, `pyogrio` and `rasterstats`
# publish manylinux wheels with their own GDAL/PROJ shared objects bundled, and
# those load normally on Debian. So `python:3.12-slim` plus `pip install -r
# requirements.txt` is the whole geospatial stack, with no apt-get GDAL to keep
# in step with the wheels - which is the classic way to end up with two GDALs
# and a segfault. If a wheel ever goes missing for a platform, the escape hatch
# is one build argument rather than a rewrite:
#
#   docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-small-3.9.2 .
#
# (that base ships a system Python, so pip then needs
# `--break-system-packages`; it is a fallback, not the tested path.)
#
# **Two stages, because the data is 3.82 GiB.** `app` holds the code only and
# expects `data/` to be bind-mounted - that is the day-to-day image, rebuilt in
# seconds. `portable` is `app` with the whole data tree copied in, which is the
# image that fits on a USB stick and runs the demo on a machine that has never
# seen this repo. `portable` is last, so a bare `docker build .` produces the
# self-contained one; `--target app` asks for the small one. See
# docker-compose.yml for which service uses which.
#
# **No secrets, ever.** `.env` is excluded in .dockerignore and the source is
# copied path by path rather than with `COPY . .`, so a key cannot arrive by
# accident. `GROQ_API_KEY` is passed at run time, and `RDH_BEARER_TOKEN` can
# only ever be passed at run time: it expires after 10 hours, so a token baked
# into an image is dead before the image is useful.

# Same application, with the corpus and the rasters inside it. This is the one to
# build once the fetch has finished and to carry on a USB stick: it needs nothing
# from the venue network and nothing from the Windows machine.
#
# It is the LAST stage deliberately, so the default `docker build .` is the image
# that cannot fail for lack of data. It costs ~4 GiB and a long first build; the
# alternative is a 2 GiB image plus a folder someone has to remember to copy, and
# the folder is the half that gets forgotten.
#
# `*.part` files are excluded in .dockerignore, so a download that was still in
# flight at build time cannot be baked in as if it were a complete raster.
