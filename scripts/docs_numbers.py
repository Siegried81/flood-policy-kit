"""Measure the facts the docs quote, and keep every marked copy of them current.

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/docs_numbers.py --json             # measure

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/docs_numbers.py --check [files]    # CI gate

Why this is a script and not a habit. The test count was corrected by hand seven
times in one day across four files, and one stale copy survived for hours. A
number typed into a doc is a copy, and copies rot; a number DERIVED from the
artefact at write time cannot. So each fact below is a function that reads the
artefact itself - never another doc - and the docs carry the value inside a
marked block that only this script edits:

    <!-- numbers:tests_collected -->513<!-- /numbers -->

`--write` replaces the text between the markers and leaves every other byte
alone, so a doc owner keeps the prose and gives up only the digit. `--check`
exits 1 and names each stale block, which is what makes the suite (and CI) fail
the next time someone types a number again. Files with no markers pass vacuously.
