"""Fetch CDS ensemble members, and prove each one is the one asked for.

**Why this exists.** The dataset offers eight climate simulations (a GCM, a
regional model and a realisation each) routed through two gridded hydrological
models, so sixteen members per period under one emissions pathway. Two are on
disk - EC-EARTH r12i1p1 / CCLM4-8-17 through E-HYPEgrid and VIC-WUR - so every
regional figure in `context.parquet` is two model chains' opinion of one world.
`--all-missing` requests the other fourteen per period, one request each, and a
request that lives in the repo is reproducible where a form filled in on a
Tuesday is not.

**Credentials.** The CDS needs an API key: register at
<https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu>, accept the dataset's licence on its download
page, then put the key in `~/.cdsapirc` or the `CDSAPI_KEY` environment variable
(with `CDSAPI_URL=https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api`). The script checks that
one of the two exists before it builds a client, says which is missing, and
never reads, caches or prints the key itself.

**The cost cap is a PRODUCT, not a sum.** The form refuses a request whose
selections multiply past 1,000. So this script requests ONE period, ONE
hydrological model and ONE simulation per call, which is also what makes the
result checkable: every file that comes back must describe exactly what was
asked for.

**It verifies rather than trusts.** The CDS returns a ZIP whose member filenames
carry the whole request, and `src/climate.py::describe` already parses that
grammar. Every extracted file is parsed and compared field by field against the
request - hydrological model, period, realisation, GCM and regional model - and
a mismatch is an error, because the failure that matters is not an empty
download, it is a download of the *wrong member* landing in the directory the
ensemble is built from, where it would silently become a second opinion from the
same world.

Run:

    python scripts/fetch_cds_member.py --dry-run --all-missing   # list, fetch nothing
    python scripts/fetch_cds_member.py --all-missing             # every missing member
    python scripts/fetch_cds_member.py --model vic_wur --period 2071_2100 \\
        --gcm hadgem2_es --rcm rca4 --member r1i1p1               # one member
