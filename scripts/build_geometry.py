"""Freeze the choropleth's polygons into `data/processed/regions.geojson`.

The React UI draws the map as SVG straight from GeoJSON - no tile provider, no
API key - so the map still renders with the venue Wi-Fi unplugged. That design
needs one file nothing in this repo produced: `api/main.py` serves
`data/processed/regions.geojson` on `/api/geometry`, and without it the endpoint
answers 404 and `Choropleth.jsx` returns null. The map was unbuildable from a
clean checkout. This script is the missing half.

Three choices here are load-bearing:

* **Simplify in EPSG:3035, convert to 4326 afterwards.** A tolerance is a
  distance, and degrees are not one: 0.01 deg is about 1.1 km north-south
  everywhere but 700 m east-west at Belgian latitudes and under 500 m in
  northern Finland. Simplifying in degrees therefore thins the north of the map
  harder than the south, which is visible as ragged Scandinavian coastline next
  to smooth Mediterranean coastline.

* **The property names ARE the join key.** `Choropleth.jsx` looks up
  `feature.properties[idKey]`, where `idKey` is whatever `/api/exposure`
  reports - `nuts_id` for a NUTS3 run, `lau_id` for a LAU zoom
  (`api.main._region_key`). GISCO calls the same field `NUTS_ID`. Shipping the
  GISCO spelling draws all 1,345 regions in the "not measured" grey, because the
  join finds nothing and nothing errors.

* **Every other attribute is dropped.** GISCO carries 17 per polygon; the UI
  reads two, `nuts_id` and `name`. The rest is bytes a browser downloads on
  every page load and never looks at.

The output is a derived file, like `exposure.parquet`: `data/` is gitignored, so
this runs after `python -m src.fetch` and before the first demo.
