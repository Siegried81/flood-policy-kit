"""Freeze the per-region context table: data/processed/context.parquet.

One row per region, holding what `exposure.parquet` deliberately does not: the
built-up surface in the way of the water, the protected Natura 2000 area under
it, how much of a region drains into a basin it shares with another country, how
the flood discharge moves under a climate scenario, how much of it lies in the
member state's own areas of potential significant flood risk, and the Eurostat
denominators that qualify a region without describing its residents'
vulnerability (GDP, population density, household income). `src/assets.py`,
`src/environment.py`, `src/basins.py`, `src/climate.py`, `src/apsfr.py` and
`src/demographics.py` compute these; this script is what turns them into
something both UIs and the brief can read.

**A second table, not more columns on the first.** Two reasons, and the second
is the load-bearing one.

* **Different grain.** `exposure.parquet` is one row per region x return period.
  Basin sharing and climate change are per region: putting them in the long
  table repeats each value once per period and invites someone to average them.

* **`api/main.py` picks the vulnerability index's indicators by looking for
  numeric columns** (`vulnerability_indicators`, minus `NON_INDICATOR_COLUMNS`).
  A climate percentage or an area share landing in a min-max-scaled weighted
  mean by accident would be a wrong number nobody would see. Keeping them out of
  that table keeps it from happening by construction rather than by remembering.

The join key is the region identifier, the same one `/api/exposure` reports.

**What this table is NOT.** It is not comparable, column to column, with the
exposure table's `exposed_pop`:

* the built-up figures are measured at ONE return period, named in the output,
  not at every one;
* they are measured on the hazard raster **as masked**, the same way the
  exposure table is, so that at least is like for like;
* the climate columns are a change in river DISCHARGE, not in depth or extent -
  the direction and size of a change, never a future headcount.
