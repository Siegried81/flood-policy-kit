# Data notice — `data/processed/`

The MIT licence of this repository covers the **code only**. The two tables
committed here, `exposure.parquet` and `context.parquet`, are derived from
third-party datasets and remain subject to their licences. They have been
modified: aggregated per NUTS3 region, reprojected, thresholded, and in places
NUTS2 figures applied to NUTS3 children. None of the original publishers is
responsible for these results.

`regions.geojson` is deliberately **not** committed. It is a simplified copy of
the GISCO NUTS geometry, whose terms grant a non-transferable right to use and
process for non-commercial purposes only, which a public MIT repository cannot
pass on. `python scripts/build_geometry.py` rebuilds it in seconds from the
boundary file `python -m src.fetch` downloads.

## One legacy column name

`exposure.parquet` was frozen on 2026-10-07, before the poverty rate gained its
unit in its name. It carries `poverty_rate`, `poverty_rate_year` and
`poverty_rate_level`; the current build writes `poverty_rate_pct*`. Both UIs and
the API read it through `src.demographics.with_current_names`, so the figures are
the same. A rebuild writes the new names.
