# CEMS-Flood wiki review: what the ECMWF Confluence tree holds for the kit

Read on 2026-10-24. The whole `CEMS-Flood` tree on
`confluence.ecmwf.int` (root page 239344446) was read through the anonymous
REST API (`/rest/api/content/<id>?expand=body.view`, then `/child/page` and
`/child/attachment`). The crawl was breadth-first, one request at a time, at
least 0.5 s apart. No login and no cookies were used.

- **Pages read: 333 of 333 reachable, 0 failed.** Pages that anonymous users
  cannot see do not appear in the child listings, so their number is unknown.
  Several pages show "Unable to load page tree" for anonymous users. This only
  affects the page-tree widget; the REST child listing still returned every
  page.
- **Attachments listed: 2,151** (5.03 GB in total). 2,086 of them are images.
  None was downloaded except the 53 KB CEMS-FLOODS licence PDF linked from the
  EWDS catalogue. Sizes come from the API's `fileSize`.
- **Verdicts: 25 USEFUL, 29 MAYBE, 279 NOT.** Most NOT pages are GloFAS-only,
  forecast-operations or navigation pages.
- **Outside the wiki** (small read-only checks, named where they are used):
  - the anonymous EFAS WMS `GetCapabilities` (212 KB), five `GetFeatureInfo`
    calls (three refused for their format) and two empty `GetMap` calls;
  - the EWDS catalogue record and licence PDF for `efas-historical`;
  - two JRC Data Catalogue records;
  - 13 JRC FTP directory listings;
  - the `efas.eu` terms page, which is only a React shell;
  - the kit's own local `jrc_flood_hazard/README.txt` and `CHANGELOG.txt`.

This file does not repeat `docs/copernicus_review.md`. Section 2 corrects it.

## 1. The six questions

### Q1. Fitting period of the EFAS v5.x thresholds, and do v5.1 thresholds match the `version_5_0` reanalysis on EWDS?

**Fitting period: 1992-01-01 to 2022-12-31 (31 years).**

- The EFAS FAQ says: "The modelled long-term discharge series (e.g.
  1992-2022 in the case of EFASv5) is used to calculate return period
  thresholds ... based on the Gumbel extreme value distribution."
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/293701841/7+FAQ+in+EFAS>
- Every v5.x release page states "Reference climatology (for thresholds/
  anomalies): 1992-01-01 to 2022-12-31". See v5.0
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/388511564/EFAS+v5.0>, v5.1
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/435948254/EFAS+v5.1> and the
  current v5.6
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/265028277/Latest+operational+EFAS+release>.
- The method is a Gumbel fit by L-moments. The code is
  `ec-jrc/lisflood-utilities` (thresholds), and `mu`/`sigma` are published.
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/242067380/Auxiliary+Data>
- For comparison, EFAS v4 used 1991-2017 (5 km)
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/265028202/EFAS+v4.0>, and
  GloFAS v4 used 1979-2022 (Auxiliary Data page).

**Consistency with `version_5_0`: yes, same model run.**

- v5.1 (2024-03-21) is a *minor* release. The versioning rules say only a
  major release changes "the LISFLOOD model output" and "is always followed by
  a new release of the historical simulations".
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/265028159/EFAS+versioning+system>
- The v5.1 page says "This upgrade of EFAS has no impact on the EFAS modelling
  results" and keeps internal number 20, the same as v5.0. Its threshold items
  are "EFAS flood threshold made available on wiki" and "Bug fixes to flood
  threshold calculation".
- So "v5.1" names the *threshold product release*. The thresholds are fitted
  to the v5.0 hydrological run, which EWDS serves as `version_5_0` (there is
  no `version_5_1` historical).

**Caveats to carry into the kit:**

- **Use the v5.1 files, not the older v5 files.** The Auxiliary Data page also
  holds 11 *unlinked* `flood_threshold_efas_v5_*.nc` attachments of the same
  size. They are most likely the pre-fix set. Use only the linked `v5.1`
  files, as the kit already does.
- **2021 is inside the fitting window.** The July 2021 annual maximum is one of
  the 31 values the Gumbel was fitted on (an in-sample estimate). At a cell
  where July 2021 is the record, this pulls the fitted return levels towards
  it, so the event's return period is somewhat understated. Say "against
  EFAS v5 return levels fitted on 1992-2022, which include 2021".
- **The calibration window (1990-2021) also includes July 2021.**
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/340784754/EFAS+v5.0+-+Calibration+Data>
- **Re-issued data after 2022 does not affect the fit.** Known Issues: v5
  historical data from 2023-01-01 was wrong until the hotfix of 29 May 2024
  and had to be re-downloaded. This is outside 1992-2022, so the thresholds
  are untouched.
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/265028278/EFAS+-+Known+Issues>
- **Unverified:** whether the annual maxima are taken from the 6-hourly series
  or from daily means. The wiki does not say for EFAS. GloFAS v5 says "annual
  maxima" of daily data.

### Q2. The EFAS v5 grid: resolution, projection, domain, upstream-area floor

**Grid: 1 arcmin (0.0166667°, "~1.4 km"), regular lat/lon on WGS84
(EPSG:4326).** It is not ETRS89-LAEA and not 1 km.

- Model Output, "EFAS Horizontal Resolution and Projection": "Since EFAS v5.0
  ... 1 arcmin/ 0.0166667 degrees resolution (~1.4km) ... World Geodetic
  System 1984 (EPSG 4326)".
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/242067364/Model+Output>
- ETRS89-LAEA (EPSG:3035) was the **5 km** grid of EFAS v4.0 and earlier:
  1000 × 950 cells, origin (2,500,000; 5,500,000) m.
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/242067380/Auxiliary+Data>,
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/242067397/Data+Structure+and+Formats>.
  No EFAS version ever used 1 km LAEA.

**Size and domain (now verified, previously inferred from a file size):**

- **4530 columns × 2970 rows.** Source: the LDD v5 metadata (`lon = 4530`,
  `lat = 2970`, `GeoTransform = "-25.25 0.01666666666666666 0 72.25 0
  -0.01666666666666666"`) and the threshold metadata.
- The outer edges are **lon -25.25 to 50.25, lat 22.75 to 72.25**. Cell
  centres run from -25.24167 to 50.24167 and from 72.24167 to 22.75833.
- The domain was "enlarged to match the river catchments" in v5.0, "from
  northern Africa beyond the northern tip of Scandinavia ... far into the
  Atlantic ... as far as to the Caspian Sea".

**The upstream-area floor is not one number:**

- **150 km²** is the working floor. "most of our products/layers use 150 km2
  as a threshold" (Model Output). It is also the floor of the flood inundation
  (hazard) maps from EFAS v5
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/340774762/CEMS-Flood+flood+inundation+maps>,
  of the calibration stations (v5 calibration methodology, 340784760) and of
  the recommended point extractions (FTP page).
- **50 km²** is the floor below which EFAS is "not recommended". Flood
  probability / reporting-point signals are computed for upstream > 50 km² and
  only where the 1.5-year return level > 1 m³/s
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/514313079>.
- **150-1,000 km²** is the band for ERIC flash-flood points.
- For the kit, **keep 150 km²**. It matches both the hazard maps and the
  thresholds' intended use.
- **Where to get v5 upstream area:** the wiki's v5 upstream-area metadata
  still reads "TBD". The file comes from EWDS (`upstream_area`,
  `version_5_0`), or without an account from the JRC FTP (see section 3,
  item 3).

### Q3. EFAS historical/reanalysis: variables, time steps, discharge definition, known issues, versions

Source unless stated: Model Output
<https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/242067364/Model+Output>.

- **Variables from v5.1:**
  - river discharge (`dis06`, param 240023);
  - soil wetness index, root zone (`swir`);
  - runoff water equivalent, surface plus subsurface (`rowe`, accumulated);
  - snow depth water equivalent (`sd`, instantaneous).
  - Volumetric soil moisture (3 layers) was **withdrawn on 2024-03-20**. It is
    still served for the reanalysis only up to that date.
  - Static fields (upstream area, elevation, soil depth, field capacity,
    wilting point) are on EWDS.
- **Time step: 6-hourly from v4.0 onwards** (24-hourly up to v3.5).
  - Internally, LISFLOOD runs 6-hourly for all processes and **hourly for
    river routing**
    <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/340784752/EFAS+v5.0+-+Hydrological+Model>.
  - Coverage of v5.0: 1992-01-01 to near real time with a 6-day lag. Real time
    is partner-only.
- **Discharge definition: a mean over the model step, not an instantaneous
  value.** GRIB name "Mean discharge in the last 6 hours", `stepType=avg`. The
  definition reads: "averaged over a time step through a cross-section". An
  annual maximum of `dis06` therefore sits below the instantaneous peak; this
  matters most on small, flashy rivers such as the Vesdre.
- **The wiki contradicts itself on the time stamp. Unresolved; check
  `valid_time` in the file.**
  - Model Output: the time stamp is the "date and time of end of averaging
    period".
  - Known Issues (Aug-Sept 2023 entry): "in MARS, data is archived at the
    beginning of the timestep", so "the 12:00 timestep represents average
    discharge over the following 6 hours (i.e. from 12:00 to 18:00)".
  - This shifts the timing of a peak by 6 h. It does not change its size.
- **Known issues relevant to the kit**
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/265028278/EFAS+-+Known+Issues>:
  - v5 historical data from 2023-01-01 was wrong until 29 May 2024
    (re-download). It does not affect July 2021.
  - v5.0 historical was shifted by 6 h when first archived; fixed by
    2023-09-13.
  - EFAS NetCDF from the CDS was corrupt on 19-21 March 2024.
  - Precipitation over Poland was too low in July-September 2025.
  - Area extraction was broken for **EFAS v4 and older**: it was removed
    there, and the extraction software was updated on 2025-12-03. v5 cropping
    works. The "Extract subset" page still says "removed", which is stale.
  - From 2026-09-02 the water balance uses Hargreaves instead of
    Penman-Monteith (no effect on 2021).
- **Versions:**
  - v5.0 is the only v5 historical run. Minor releases 5.1-5.6 share it.
  - v4.0 ran on the 5 km LAEA grid, 1991 onwards, with thresholds on
    1991-2017. **The system operational in July 2021 was v4.2.**
  - Forcing for v5: the **EMO-1** 1 arcmin observation grids (SPHEREMAP
    interpolation, Penman-Monteith ET0), 1990 onwards
    <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/333803146/EFAS+v5.0+meteorological+forcing>.
  - Calibration used 1,903 stations of at least 150 km² (43.4 % of the
    domain); the rest is regionalised. The median KGE' is **0.694**
    <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/340784732/EFAS+v5.0+-+Hydrological+Model+Performances>.
- **Archive size:** "EFAS climatology" (the historical dataset, all variables)
  is **817 GB** on MARS
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/242067425/EWDS+-+Best+Practices>.

### Q4. How the JRC hazard maps v3.1.1 relate to EFAS, and what EFAS does with flood protection

**Same chain.** The v3.x hazard maps are the CEMS-Flood inundation catalogue
built from the **EFAS v5.0 reanalysis**.

- The kit's local `README.txt` for v3.1.1 lists "EFAS v5.0 hydrological
  reanalysis" among its inputs (R03), cites the efas-historical v5.0 DOI
  (R02), and links the wiki method page from the CHANGELOG.
- EFAS v5.0 release notes: "new flood hazard maps, generated using
  LISFLOOD-FP at 90m resolution and MERIT hydro DM and EFAS v5.0 reference
  dataset" (v5.0 page).

**Method**
<https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/340774762/CEMS-Flood+flood+inundation+maps>:

- In every cell above 150 km², a Gumbel fit to the reanalysis annual maxima
  gives the peak for each return period.
- A synthetic hydrograph is built from the Giandotti time of concentration.
- **The 1.5-year discharge is subtracted** as a stand-in for bankfull channel
  flow (channel depth is set to 0).
- LISFLOOD-FP is run on MERIT-DEM at 3 arcsec, one domain every 5 km of
  channel, with Manning's n taken from CGLS land cover.
- Domains are mosaicked by maximum depth.

**Differences to note:**

- The wiki page (Sept 2023) lists **7** return periods (10/20/50/75/100/200/
  500). The kit's v3.1.1 has **9** (it adds 30 and 40). The page predates
  v3.0 (2024-03-08), so it is stale on that point.
- The README's recommended citation for v3.x is **Baugh, Colonese, D'Angelo,
  Dottori, Neal, Prudhomme, Salamon (2024), "An updated dataset of global and
  European flood hazard maps", manuscript in preparation**. It is **not**
  Dottori et al., ESSD 2022, which documents v2.0.0 (see section 4).

**Flood protection in EFAS.**

- **Static layer "Flood Protection Levels"**: "the estimated design return
  period of flood defences ... It is assumed that any flood event above the
  protection level will cause flooding."
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/265028366/Static+Layers+Overview>
  - The source is "Bianchi et al., 2022" within the EU, at sub-catchment
    scale. The link points to the JRC dataset 1019a72f, "Flood impacts and
    adaptation strategies under future scenarios" (PESETA IV collection,
    released 2022-09-16).
  - Outside the EU the source is FLOPROS, at the second administrative level.
  - It was updated in **v5.2 (13 Aug 2024)** "using new information
    doi:10.1038/s41558-022-01540-0" (Dottori et al. 2023, NCC)
    <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/462906834/EFAS+v5.2>.
- **The same layer as the kit's? Very likely.** The kit's
  `floodProtection_v2019_paper.zip` sits in the JRC FTP folder
  `PESETAIV/Paper_floods/`. That folder was released in September 2022 and
  holds the inputs of that same paper (listing checked).
  - **Unverified:** that EFAS uses this exact raster. Its layer is described
    as "sub-catchment scale", which matches.
  - If confirmed, the brief can say: *"the same protection standards EFAS uses
    operationally in its rapid impact assessment"*.
- **Rapid impact assessment (RIA) method**
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/333791664/CEMS-Flood+flood+impact+forecasting>,
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/265028472/EFAS+Rapid+Flood+Mapping+and+Rapid+Impact+Assessment>:
  - River cells where the forecast median exceeds the 10-year return level
    pick the inundation map at the next lower return period. The maps are
    mosaicked, and depth ≥ **0.099 m** counts as "flooded".
  - This gives the **unprotected** scenario.
  - The **protected** scenario drops every river cell whose forecast return
    period does not exceed the local protection level, then re-maps.
  - Both are overlaid on **GHS-POP R2023A 2020, 3 arcsec**, then on land cover
    and OSM critical infrastructure. Results are summed per NUTS (or GADM)
    region, "typically level 1 or 2".
  - The pop-up shows both columns, PROTECTED and UNPROTECTED.
  - This is the **same undefended-versus-residual contrast the brief makes**,
    done operationally by EFAS. The granularity differs: EFAS removes whole
    river cells upstream, while the kit masks the population cells where the
    standard ≥ RP.
- **Stated limitations that support the brief's caveats** (same page):
  - "The 3 arc second (~90 m) spatial resolution ... will be insufficient to
    represent local topographic features such as levees";
  - "generated assuming natural river flows" (no diversion or dam retention);
  - riverine only, with no pluvial or coastal flooding;
  - biased wherever the reanalysis is biased;
  - FLOPROS "does not give the precise location and protection level of
    individual assets".
- History: until v4.6 (Oct 2022) the Rapid Flood Mapping layer showed the
  *protected* extent. Since then it shows the unprotected one
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/311138753/EFAS+v4.6>.

### Q5. Any EFAS/GloFAS product with impacts (population affected), and is it public?

**Yes: the Rapid Impact Assessment (EFAS and GloFAS)** gives population,
roads, land cover and critical infrastructure per admin region, for both the
protected and unprotected scenarios (Q4 pages).

**Access: real time is partner-only; the archive is public after a 30-day
embargo.**

- "All real-time EFAS forecasts and products are restricted ... the restricted
  EFAS real-time forecasts are released publicly after an embargo of 30 days"
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/293701137/2+EFAS+products+overview>.
- Flood Summary layers (RIA among them) "become publicly available for any
  date older than the embargo period"
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/293701358/3.2.2+Layer+categories+explained>.
- "The EFAS WMS-T is freely accessible for non authenticated users ... (only
  forecasts older than 30 days)"
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/247897113>.

**Verified today without login:**

- The anonymous WMS `GetCapabilities` lists the following layers:
  - `mapserver:RapidImpactAssessment`, queryable, time
    `2019-10-07T00:00/2026-09-24T12:00/PT12H`, so the default is today minus
    30 days;
  - `mapserver:RapidFloodMapping`;
  - `mapserver:FloodProtectionLevels` (`public=true`);
  - `mapserver:Europe_combined_flood_scenarios`;
  - `mapserver:gfm_affected_population`.
- `GetFeatureInfo` with `INFO_FORMAT=application/json` returns the RIA pop-up
  table. `text/plain` and `gml` are refused.
- Two calls were made at a point near Liège (50.62 N, 5.55 E).

| Forecast | Population affected, protected | Population affected, unprotected | Mean RP | Protection level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2021-07-13 12 UTC | 170,300 | 259,600 | 200 yr | 143 yr |
| 2021-07-14 12 UTC | 249,800 | 264,000 | 200 yr | 143 yr |

Both forecasts placed the region in the "high likelihood / high impact"
matrix cell.

**Caveats on these numbers:**

- They are *forecasts* from EFAS **v4.2**: 5 km, the older 100 m maps and the
  pre-2024 protection layer. The layer abstract says "100m resolution flood
  hazard".
- The admin unit is **not identified** in the response. It is probably the
  merged NUTS2/3 Liège unit: **unverified**.
- The figure is people inside the forecast flood extent, not people harmed.

**Other impact products:**

- GloFAS RIA as shapefiles (`CostPopEst{date}.shp`) on the GloFAS FTP, with a
  password on request
  <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/242067469/FTP>.
- GFM "affected population" layers in the same WMS. GFM is partner-only in the
  viewer.
- Experimental radar flash-flood impact layers (GHSL + HARCI-EU exposure).
  These are hourly, recent-only and not useful for 2021.

### Q6. Recommended citation and licence wording for EFAS data

The wiki itself has **no EFAS citation text**. It points to the licence
(`efas.eu/en/terms-and-conditions`, a React page) and to the EWDS DOIs. The
binding text is the **CEMS-FLOODS datasets licence**. It is linked from the
EWDS `efas-historical` record as
`https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/.../cems-floods_428a6e10....pdf`
(53 KB, read in full).

- **Allowed:** reproduction, distribution, communication to the public,
  adaptation/modification/combination, and any combination of these. Some
  data is restricted under Art. 12 of Delegated Regulation 1159/2013; that is
  the real-time data.
- **Notice for unmodified data:** *"Generated using Copernicus Emergency
  Management Service information [Year]"*.
- **Notice for adapted data:** *"Contains modified Copernicus Emergency
  Management Service information [Year]"*.
- **Disclaimer to repeat:** the data "does not constitute in any way a flood
  warning for which only national/regional institutions are authorized".
- **Dataset citations:**
  - **EFAS historical v5.0**, as cited by the hazard-map README (R02):

## 2. Corrections to `docs/copernicus_review.md`

| Where | It said | The wiki says | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| EFAS historical, sizes | "One full-domain field is about 54 MB ... a full-domain year ... roughly 78 GB"; "Not recommended: EFAS historical for a Europe-wide trend ... 34 years at 6-hourly steps is terabytes" | The *whole* EFAS historical dataset (all variables, all versions) is **817 GB** on MARS, and the documented request size is ~450 MB per 1,000 fields in GRIB2 (EWDS Best Practices, 242067425). 54 MB is the uncompressed float32 NetCDF size; packed GRIB2 fields are far smaller. | "Terabytes" is wrong. A 1992-2022 discharge-only pull is tens to a few hundred GB (**inference**: the 450 MB per 1,000 fields figure may predate the 1 arcmin grid). HERA is still the better trend source (1951-2020, no queue). |
| EFAS historical, limits | 1,500 fields per request (measured) | The wiki table says 1,000 for "EFAS climatology" | Keep the **measured 1,500**; the wiki table is stale. Add: no more than 10 parallel requests, and MARS sessions on Wednesdays slow the queue. |
| EFAS historical, discharge | "a mean over the preceding 6 h" | Model Output: the time stamp marks the end of the averaging period. Known Issues: MARS archives at the start of the step, so 12:00 means 12:00-18:00. | Mark the time stamp as **conflicting in the source**; check `valid_time` in the file before quoting peak *times*. |
| Thresholds, "Unverified" | fitting period unknown (GloFAS v4: 1979-2022) | **1992-2022** for EFAS v5 (FAQ; release tables) | Resolved: see Q1. |
| Thresholds, "Unverified" | whether v5.1 matches `version_5_0` | Same model run; v5.1 is a minor release with "no impact on the EFAS modelling results" | Resolved: see Q1. |

## 3. Ranked: what to add to the kit

| # | What | Why it matters for the brief | Access | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **EFAS's own July 2021 rapid impact assessment**, archived. Anonymous WMS `GetFeatureInfo` (JSON) on `mapserver:RapidImpactAssessment`, one point per affected NUTS region (BE, DE, NL), forecasts 12-15 July 2021. | An official, operational **protected vs unprotected** headcount from the same JRC/CEMS family. It shows the undefended/residual contrast is how EFAS itself reasons. It also gives the real-time view of what was expected before the flood. | None, but needs the network: run it before the event, cache the JSON, and respect the one-request-per-second rule. | 2-3 h |
| 2 | **Quote the threshold facts correctly**: fitted on 1992-2022, which includes 2021; same run as `version_5_0`; Gumbel L-moments; use only the `v5.1` files; calibration 1990-2021. | Removes the open "check the wiki" caveat in `sources.yaml` (`efas_flood_thresholds`), and adds the in-sample caveat. | - | 0.5 h |
| 3 | **EFAS v5 upstream area without an account**: `upArea_European_01min.nc`, 51 MB, JRC FTP `CEMS-EFAS/LISFLOOD_static_and_parameter_maps_for_EFAS/v1.1.2_OS-LISFLOOD-v4.x/Catchments_morphology_and_river_network/` (the static maps released for EFAS v5, with `EFASv5.0_calibrated_parameters` beside them). | Masks the July 2021 discharge and thresholds to river cells ≥ 150 km² without the EWDS step. | None (JRC FTP). **Unverified:** that it is identical to EWDS `upstream_area` v5.0; compare one tile. Do not use the newer `v.2.0.0_OS-LISFLOOD-v5.x` folder: it is labelled EFAS **v6.0**. | 1 h |
| 4 | **EMO-1 observed precipitation, 2021**: `EMO-1arcmin-pr_2021.nc` (daily, 335 MB) or `pr6_2021.nc` (6-hourly, 777 MB), JRC FTP `CEMS-EFAS/meteorological_forcings/EMO-1arcmin/`. | The *observed* rainfall that forced EFAS. Maximum 1-day and 3-day July 2021 rain per NUTS3 is the pluvial/surface-runoff counterpart that `limitations.md` says the hazard maps lack. | None. One 335 MB year file; RAM is fine for a July slice. | 3-4 h |
| 5 | **EFAS's flooded-depth cut-off: depth ≥ 0.099 m** (CEMS-Flood impact forecasting). | An official precedent for the kit's depth threshold, which `limitations.md` names as a choice that moves the headline (-14.2 % at RP100). Cite it in the sensitivity note. | - | 0.5 h |
| 6 | **Protection-layer provenance**: EFAS's EU "Flood Protection Levels" = Bianchi et al. 2022 / PESETA IV (JRC 1019a72f), in use since v5.2. | Strengthens the residual figure: same family as the layer EFAS uses operationally. Also note EFAS's simplifying assumption that "any flood event above the protection level will cause flooding". | Optional check: one `GetFeatureInfo` on `FloodProtectionLevels` at 3-4 points, compared with the kit's raster. | 1 h |
| 7 | **Model skill line**: EFAS v5 median KGE' 0.694 over 1,903 calibration stations; only 43.4 % of the domain gauged. | A one-line credibility and uncertainty statement for the July 2021 return periods. | - | 0.2 h |
| 8 | **Live WMS overlays** (`FloodProtectionLevels`, `Europe_combined_flood_scenarios`) in the app. | Visual cross-check only. | Needs the network at the venue, so **not recommended** for the offline kit. | - |

---

## 4. Things in the kit's documents that this review touches (not edited)

- `flood-policy-kit/docs/brief_draft.md`, section 5 ("Sources"): "JRC
  river-flood hazard maps (9 return periods) and their validation (Dottori et
  al., ESSD 2022)". The maps used are **v3.1.1**. Their method is the EFAS v5
  chain above and their reference is **Baugh et al. (2024, in prep.)**.
  Dottori et al. 2022 validates v2.0.0. `sources.yaml` already has this
  caveat (`jrc_hazard_maps_validation_essd_2022`), but the brief does not.
  Suggested wording: "JRC/CEMS river-flood hazard maps v3.1.1 (method: CEMS
  wiki, built on the EFAS v5 reanalysis; validation of the previous
  generation: Dottori et al., ESSD 2022)".
- `brief_draft.md` key messages: "the JRC's own '160,000 exposed annually'".
  The CEMS Data FAQ quotes PESETA IV as **"170,000 people"** a year in the
  EU + UK at present
  (<https://confluence.ecmwf.int/spaces/CEMS/pages/242067503/FAQs>). Check
  which figure and which scope (EU-27 or EU + UK) the brief's source uses.
- `config/sources.yaml` `efas_flood_thresholds` caveat ("Check the CEMS wiki
  for the fitting period before quoting") can now be answered. Its comment
  `crs: EPSG:4326 # EFAS v5 grid, 1 arcmin` is correct.
- `efas_historical_july_2021`: add that EFAS operational in July 2021 was
  **v4.2** (5 km). The data being fetched is the later v5.0 re-run, not what
  forecasters saw at the time.
- `limitations.md`: the EFAS wiki states that the maps are "generated assuming
  natural river flows" and cannot resolve levees at 90 m. This is a citable
  source for the "undefended" reading of v3.1.1 that does not rely on the 2022
  paper.

---

## 5. Not verified (check before quoting)

- Whether the EFAS v5 annual maxima for the thresholds come from 6-hourly or
  daily discharge.
- The discharge time-stamp convention (end of step, per Model Output; start
  of step in MARS, per Known Issues).
- That EFAS's EU protection layer is byte-for-byte the kit's
  `floodProtection_v2019_paper` raster.
- The admin unit behind the two RIA readings near Liège, and the RIA's
  behaviour at other points and times. Only 2 forecast times at 1 point were
  queried.
- That the JRC FTP `upArea_European_01min.nc` (static maps v1.1.2) equals the
  EWDS `upstream_area` for `version_5_0`.
- Whether the EWDS `efas-historical` request keys will change the way GloFAS
  historical v5 keys did.
- The per-field GRIB2 size on the 1 arcmin grid. The "450 MB per 1,000 fields"
  figure may predate v5.
