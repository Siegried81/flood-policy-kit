# Preparation plan — 23 days

**Today: Tuesday 6 October 2026. Day 1: Thursday 29 October, 09:00 at FARI.
Day 2: Friday 30 October, until 18:00 at JRC.**

Daylight saving ends Sunday 25 October; 09:00 CET on the 29th is 09:00 Brussels
time, so nothing to adjust.

## Do today, before anything else

1. **Register.** 60 places, free, and applications are open now. Registration and
   programme: <https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/events/european-ai-challenge-2026-data-policy-2026-10-29_en>
   — the same URL `config/sources.yaml` declares as `event_page`, verified HTTP 200
   on 6 October 2026. The shorter `/jrc-events/european-ai-challenge-2026-data-policy`
   form returns 404; the path segment is `/events/` and the date suffix is part of
   the slug.
2. **Settle your eligibility in writing.** The call targets students of Belgian
   universities, *hautes écoles* and *hogescholen*. BeCode is a bootcamp, not a
   *haute école*. Write to **info@fari.brussels** today, state "BeCode AI & Data
   Science / GenAI Developer track", and ask them to confirm. Do not assume, and
   do not wait — if the answer is no you want three weeks to find another route
   (a partner university team, for instance).
3. **Ask about prepared code.** Same email: ask whether arriving with a generic
   toolkit is acceptable. Almost every hackathon allows it; getting it in writing
   removes any doubt, and asking makes a good first impression.

## The calendar

| Week | Goal | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **Mon 5 → Sun 11** | Register. Learn the domain: Floods Directive, Sendai, Hazard×Exposure×Vulnerability. Download every dataset — **52 files, ≈3.82 GiB**. Get `geopandas`/`rasterio` under your fingers. | You can produce one map of exposed population on the Vesdre valley, 2021 |
| **Mon 12 → Sun 18** | The kit: exposure pipeline, vulnerability index, Streamlit map, tests, CI. | `pytest` green, `streamlit run` shows a real map |
| **Mon 19 → Sun 25** | GenAI layer: grounded RAG over the policy corpus, brief template, responsible-AI checklist, deploy. **All downloads finished.** | App online, brief template filled with a dry-run result |
| **Mon 26 → Wed 28** | **Full dress rehearsal**: an 8-hour solo hackathon on a *different* region (Valencia DANA 2024, or Emilia-Romagna 2023). Rehearse the pitch. Rest Wednesday evening. | A timed 3-minute pitch you can deliver without notes |

## Week 1 in detail (5–11 October)

**Domain first, code second.** You cannot frame a recommendation in a field whose
vocabulary you do not have.

- Read `docs/policy_context.md` end to end. Know what a *return period* is, what
  the three stages of the Floods Directive are, and what happened in Wallonia in
  July 2021.
- Learn the vocabulary that will be in the room: *aléa* (hazard), *enjeux*
  (exposed assets), *vulnérabilité*, *période de retour*, *zone d'expansion de
  crue*, *ruissellement* (surface runoff, as opposed to river overflow).

**Then the data.** Follow `docs/datasets.md`. Target for the end of the week:
one PNG showing population exposed to a 100-year flood in the Vesdre valley,
produced by `src/exposure.py`, with the number written on it. The valley is the
rehearsal, not the answer — the deliverable is European, at NUTS3.

**The download, measured.** `python -m src.fetch` is 52 files and ≈3.82 GiB — 37
geodata downloads, 13 policy-corpus scrapes and 2 context scrapes, the `geodata`
section's other 12 jobs being runtime API calls that store nothing: the
nine return periods alone are 2.61 GiB, and four entries expand to several files
each, so the printed count is files rather than declared sources. Start it once
and leave it; it is idempotent, so a dropped connection costs only the files that
are actually missing. Do not expect `/vsicurl/` to save you the download — it
pays off for a country window (2.4 MiB for Belgium on RP100) and collapses at EU
scale (56% of the file in 35,525 requests). Both counts are `src.fetch.expand()`
over `sources.yaml` as it stood on 6 October 2026 — every entry added later moves
them, so re-derive rather than quoting this line.

**One account to open this week.** The JRC Risk Data Hub needs an EU Login
account, and its bearer token lasts 10 hours — so the account is created now and
the *token* is refreshed on the morning of the event. Fill the response cache
(`data/processed/rdh_cache/`) the day before, never live in front of a jury.

**The trap to avoid this week:** spending five days making the pipeline elegant.
It needs to be *correct* and *fast to re-point at another region*, because on the
day you will be handed a scenario you did not choose.

## Week 4: why the dress rehearsal matters most

Do the rehearsal on a region you have **not** prepared. The entire value of the
exercise is discovering which parts of your kit are secretly hard-coded to
Belgium. Everything that breaks on Valencia would have broken on day 1 of the
real event.

Timebox it exactly like the real thing: 8 hours, then a brief and a pitch. Record
the pitch on your phone and watch it once. It is unpleasant and it is the single
highest-return hour of the whole preparation.

## What to deliberately NOT do

- **No model training.** Nobody is asking for a flood prediction model, and you
  cannot validate one in two days. Analysis, not prediction.
- **No scraping on the day.** Corpus and rasters are collected before the 25th.
- **No dependency on a paid API** that might rate-limit you in front of a jury.
  Have a local fallback (Ollama) for the LLM layer.
