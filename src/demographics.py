"""Eurostat indicators at NUTS3, so the vulnerability index has something to weigh.

**Why this module exists.** `config/sources.yaml` has declared
`eurostat_population_by_age`, `eurostat_poverty` and `eurostat_gdp_nuts3` since
the start, all three `access: api`, and nothing in the repo called them. The cost
of that was not a missing column: `api/main.py::vulnerability_indicators` offered
exactly one indicator, `exposed_pop`, so the composite index was a weighted mean
of one column - which is that column - and `sensitivity` certified all 1,338
measured regions "robust" at any perturbation, because rescaling one term never
reorders it. The ranking needs a second axis before it means anything.

**What belongs here and what does not.** These are properties of the PEOPLE in a
region, which is what a vulnerability indicator is. `exposed_pop` is a property of
the flood. Both belong in `exposure.parquet`, where the index can see them. GDP is
neither - it is a denominator, and a region is not vulnerable for being rich - so
`gdp_meur` goes to `context.parquet` with the other qualifiers.

**Vintage columns are strings on purpose.** `vulnerability_indicators` picks the
index's inputs by scanning for numeric columns, so a year stored as an integer
would silently become a vulnerability indicator meaning "a more recent census
makes residents more vulnerable". Stored as text it is excluded by construction
rather than by remembering to add it to a list.

**The responses are cached to disk**, under `data/processed/eurostat_cache/`, for
the same reason `src/rdh.py` caches: the build has to be repeatable on a venue
network that is not there, and an indicator that changes between two runs of the
same build breaks the freeze the whole kit rests on.
