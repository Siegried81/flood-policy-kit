"""River basin districts: who is exposed in a basin they do not control.

NUTS3 answers "who is exposed". It cannot answer the question `docs/strategy.md`
names as the one most teams will not ask: the Meuse rises in France, floods
Belgium and reaches the Netherlands, so a warning issued nationally arrives late
downstream. That is the argument for action at EU level rather than national
level, and it needs the unit water obeys rather than the unit administrations are
drawn on.

The source is `eea_river_basin_districts` in `config/sources.yaml`: the districts
reported under the Water Framework Directive, served live from the EEA's ArcGIS
REST endpoint. Queried rather than mirrored because the EEA's bulk download is
the whole WISE package as one 3.4 GB share with no per-layer URL - and cached to
disk on first use, like `src/rdh.py`, so the day of the event needs no network.

**What this module does NOT claim.** It says nothing about *upstream*. Saying
that Wallonia's water comes from France needs a flow network, and the WFD
districts carry none - they are catchment boundaries, not topology. What is
defensible from these polygons alone is that a region's basin is **shared**: that
the ground draining into the same water body lies in more than one country, so no
single authority holds all the levers. That is weaker than "upstream" and it is
still the whole argument, because the policy conclusion - coordinate at basin
level - follows from sharing, not from direction.

**A district is not an aggregate of NUTS3 regions.** Districts cross national
borders AND cut regions in half, so every figure here is built by intersecting
areas in EPSG:3035. Summing the NUTS3 rows that "belong" to a basin would
double-count every region a boundary crosses.

      Below 1.0 the three figures above describe only that part, and coastal
      regions draining straight to sea are legitimately below it.

    Shares, never counts: a region's area in square metres would rank by how big
    it is, which nobody needs a model to find out.

    **`admin` must cover every country the districts touch.** Whether a basin is
    shared is derived from the country codes present in this frame, so a
    single-country frame would report every international basin as unshared.
    Pass the full NUTS3 layer and filter the RESULT; a frame with fewer than two
    countries is refused rather than answered wrongly.

    **The basin, not the polygon.** The WFD publishes one polygon per member
    state per basin - the Meuse arrives as a French, a Walloon, a Flemish, a
    Luxembourgish and a Dutch district, each lying inside one country - so a
    region's own district polygon can never say whether its water crosses a
    border. Measured 2026-10-06: by polygon, exactly one of the 196 districts
    spans more than one country, which reported essentially all of Europe as
    drained by water it governs. The grouping into international basins is
    declared in `config/international_basins.yaml`, because the service carries
    no field for it.

    **Still a floor, for two reasons.** Switzerland, Belarus, Ukraine, Serbia and
    the other non-reporting states hold large shares of the Rhine, the Danube,
    the Vistula and the Daugava; and the districts that cannot be grouped from
    this layer are listed as `unresolved` in that file rather than silently
    counted as national.
