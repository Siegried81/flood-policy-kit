"""Future flood hazard, per region - the one layer in this kit that is not today.

Everything else here measures present-day risk, which is a description. A region
crossing from "not a priority" to "priority" is a decision, and it is the only
thing in a brief a planner can act on years ahead.

The source is `cds_hydrology_projections` in `config/sources.yaml`: Copernicus
C3S / SMHI indicators from eight bias-adjusted EURO-CORDEX simulations forcing
E-HYPE. The variable this module is built for is the **relative change in the
N-year return value of annual maximum river discharge** between a future period
and the 1971-2000 reference, in percent.

Three properties of that data decide every design choice below.

**It is discharge, not depth.** A 50-year flow in m3/s cannot be subtracted from
or layered onto the JRC inundation maps. What travels is the direction and the
size of the change, applied to the present-day exposure computed elsewhere in
this kit. A future headcount quoted as if it had been measured is not defensible.

**A relative change has no upper bound.** Where the 1971-2000 reference discharge
is near zero - intermittent rivers, arid basins - the ratio explodes. Measured
2026-10-06 on the 50-year recurrence, 2041-2070 against 1971-2000, RCP 8.5,
E-HYPEgrid: median +16.9%, minimum -100%, maximum **+16,452,833%**. So this
module reports the MEDIAN and the quartiles and never a mean or a maximum. A mean
belongs entirely to that tail, and a maximum is a sentence that ends a pitch.

**The grid is curvilinear.** The file carries no affine transform: `lon` and `lat`
are their own 950x1000 arrays beside the variable. Resampling onto another grid
would mean interpolating a ratio, which is the same error as averaging one. The
aggregation here is therefore point-in-polygon on the real coordinates: each grid
cell contributes its own value to whichever region contains its centre, and the
region's figure is a quantile over those values.
