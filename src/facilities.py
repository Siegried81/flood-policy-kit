"""Hospitals and schools inside the flood footprint, per region.

Article 6(5) of the Floods Directive asks the flood risk maps to show the
consequences for, among others, hospitals and schools. The kit counts people
and built-up surface; this module counts the two kinds of facility a crisis
plan names first, from the Eurostat GISCO layers built out of Member States'
official sources (`gisco_healthcare`, `gisco_education` in config/sources.yaml).

Points, not areas, so the method is a lookup rather than a zonal statistic:
each facility is read at its own location in the hazard raster. Three choices
keep "flooded" meaning the same thing as in the population figures:

* **The same threshold and the same masks.** A facility counts as flooded when
  the modelled depth at its point reaches `min_depth_m` (0.5 m by default, the
  exposure table's), and never on a cell the JRC flags as permanent water or as
  a spurious depth. A hospital sited on a river bank is not "in the flood"
  because the channel next to it is wet.
* **Residual as well as undefended.** The hazard maps draw the water as if no
  dyke stood; `residual` also drops every facility whose local flood protection
  standard (`jrc_flood_protection_standards`) is at least the return period.
* **Read in sorted order.** 333,844 schools sampled in raster order let GDAL
  reuse each decompressed block instead of seeking back and forth across a
  5.7-billion-cell file.

A facility is assigned to the NUTS3 region its point falls in. A point in no
region (offshore by a geocoding error) is counted nowhere and reported, never
snapped to the nearest region.
