"""Built-up surface exposed to flooding - the asset half of the exposure term.

`exposure.py` answers "how many people are in the water". This answers "how much
is built there", which is the question behind every recommendation about where
building is still permitted. A brief that reaches only the first number can say
who to warn; it cannot say where to stop pouring concrete.

**Why this module is thin on purpose.** `exposure.exposed_population` sums
whatever per-cell quantity it is handed, over whatever grid that raster is on.
GHS-BUILT-S is on exactly the same 1 km Mollweide grid, same epoch and same cell
size as GHS-POP, so handing it the built-up raster is not a trick - it is the
same arithmetic on a different summable quantity, and duplicating the windowing,
the masking and the coverage bookkeeping to say "m2" instead of "people" would be
two implementations of one measurement, drifting apart from the first bug fixed
in only one of them.

**The unit is square metres of footprint.** Not a share, not a value, not a
building count. A warehouse and a hospital of the same size are the same number
here. This ranks what is physically at stake and says nothing about what it
costs - state that, because a jury will ask, and the honest answer is that
monetising it needs damage curves this kit does not carry.

    mean there - including the default `min_depth_m=0.0`, which is "any water".
    Pass 0.5 to match the exposure table's own default, or the two halves of the
    same brief disagree about what counts as flooded.

    The columns are renamed because `exposed_pop` would be a lie about the unit:
    `exposed_built_m2` is a surface. `cells_counted` and `hazard_coverage` keep
    their names and their meaning, and `hazard_coverage` must still be reported
    beside the figure - below 1.0 it is an extrapolation.

    **The hazard path is taken as given, masks and all.** `scripts/build_exposure.py`
    patches out permanent water bodies and the JRC's own spurious-area flags
    before measuring population, which moves the Benelux RP100 figure by -14.2%.
    Nothing here does that. A built-up figure from a raw raster is therefore NOT
    comparable with `exposed_pop` from the frozen table: it counts the river
    channel and the lakes as flooded ground. Hand this function a hazard raster
    masked the same way, or say in the brief that the two halves were measured
